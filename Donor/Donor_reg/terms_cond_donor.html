<h1>BloodAlert Donor Terms and Conditions</h1>

<h3>I acknowledge and agree to the following terms and conditions:</h3>

<ol type="1" class="styled-list">
  <li>Eligibility Confirmation</li>
  <p>
    I confirm that I meet the eligibility criteria for blood donation, including
    but not limited to age, weight, health, and medical history, as outlined by
    the blood donation center or relevant health authority.
  </p>

  <li>Accuracy of Information</li>
  <p>
    I certify that all personal information, medical history, and answers
    provided during the screening process are accurate and truthful to the best
    of my knowledge.
  </p>

  <li>Health and Safety</li>
  <p>
    I understand that blood donation involves potential risks, including but not
    limited to discomfort, bruising, dizziness, and in rare cases, more serious
    complications. I have been informed of these risks and voluntarily consent
    to proceed.
  </p>

  <li>Screening and Testing</li>
  <p>
    I understand that my blood will be tested for infectious diseases, including
    but not limited to HIV, hepatitis, and other blood-borne pathogens. I
    consent to these tests and understand that if my blood is found to be
    unsuitable for donation, it will not be used.
  </p>

  <li>Confidentiality</li>
  <p>
    I understand that my personal and medical information will be kept
    confidential and only shared with authorized personnel involved in the
    donation process, in compliance with applicable privacy laws.
  </p>

  <li>Voluntary Donation</li>
  <p>
    I acknowledge that this donation is voluntary and that I will not receive
    any payment or other incentives in exchange for my donation.
  </p>

  <li>Right to Refuse</li>
  <p>
    I understand that the blood donation center reserves the right to refuse my
    donation if it is determined that my blood does not meet safety standards or
    if there are concerns about my health.
  </p>

  <li>Post-Donation Care</li>
  <p>
    I agree to follow the post-donation care instructions provided by the blood
    donation center to ensure my safety and well-being after the procedure.
  </p>

  <li>Withdrawal of Consent</li>
  <p>
    I understand that I may withdraw my consent at any time before the blood
    collection begins, and doing so will not affect my right to receive medical
    care.
  </p>

  <li>Legal Release</li>
  <p>
    I release the blood donation center, its staff, and affiliated organizations
    from any liability, claims, or damages that may arise from my participation
    in the blood donation process, except in cases of negligence or willful
    misconduct.
  </p>

  <li>Data Privacy and Confidentiality</li>
  <p>
    I agree to the collection, storage, and processing of my personal
    information, including health data, within the BloodAlert. I understand that
    this information will be shared with the connected blood bank for purposes
    related to my donation and follow-up. The app and blood bank are committed
    to maintaining the confidentiality of my data in accordance with applicable
    privacy laws, including the GDPR or similar local regulations.
  </p>

  <li>Communication and Notifications</li>
  <p>
    I consent to receiving notifications via email regarding my blood donation
    schedule, eligibility reminders, and urgent requests for donations. I
    understand that I can opt-out of non-essential communications at any time
    via the app's settings.
